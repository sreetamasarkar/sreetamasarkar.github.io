I am a third-year PhD student at [EESSC](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/) lab in the [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Peter Beerel](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Beerel/Peter). My research interests lie in the field of Scalable and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence - I aspire to make Machine Learning models more hardware-friendly while ensuring their robust and secure deployment. My recent works involve efficient [fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10951) and [inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12067) of transformer models for computer vision applications. 

Before this, I completed Master of Science in Communication Engineering from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I conducted my Master's thesis on *Robustness aware Pruning methods for Convolutional Neural Networks* in the Autonomous Driving Group at [BMW](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html). I completed my BTech with a gold medal in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking as it helps me unwind, and I love to try out different cuisines. I also enjoy swimming, biking and playing badminton. My creative pursuits include painting and dancing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
